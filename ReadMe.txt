Hi, glad to see you want to play with this arbitrage algorithm.

Open the Call_options_info_fileV0 and put this data:

Number of Call options you want to analyze (Number)
Name of the Option (Name)
S0=stock initial price (Number)
SH=Stock high price  (Number)
ST=Stock tails price (Number)
K=strike price (Number)
r=interest rate of the bond (Number)

Between Options you have to keep a blank space!!

Put . instead of , for decimals

After that just execute the code and see the results in Call_options_result

You will find an example as a example.txt

Always clean all the files (the result file, before doing executing the code)

Have fun and don't gamble!!
